## 0.49.7

### Patch Changes

- 3f33860: Run side threads in a dedicated full-screen TUI so mouse-drag copying stays stable while the main agent continues producing output in the background.
- 2a2c9c1: Queue Pi-style steering questions while a side-thread answer is running, process them one at a time without touching the main conversation, and report malformed side-model responses without hanging the side UI.

## 0.49.6

### Patch Changes

- a4b44ee: Route side-question completions through Pi's effective runtime provider so custom provider APIs work.
